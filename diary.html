    <div class="januar14">12.01.2020</div><p> I started working on my website it didn't go so well, I found a video that I was going to use but in the end I ended up not using it as I didn't like it so much.</p>
    <p></p>
    <div class="januar14">14.01.2020</div><p> I continued working on my website, I found a video that I liked. 
      I clicked the video and started watching it. 
      I copied the video and started making some real progress in making my site.
      I watched a video from Easy Tutorials on Youtube and it helped a lot. </p>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99vHH_6F0Ko">The video link - How To Make Website Using HTML CSS | Start To End | Step By Step Tutorial</a>

    <div class="januar14">15.01.2020</div><p>I sat down and started working on my site. 
    I had watched the video and was getting somewhere but I still didn't like what I had. 
    I started to watch other videos and implement them into my website, 
    I also went on to stackoverflow to get help with the CSS to make the site look better. 
    I worked for a quite long time as i got really deep into it and was enjoying it.
    This was the first time I started to get somewhere and I liked what I saw.</p>
    

    <div class="januar14">16.01.2020</div><p>I had done a lot of work on my website and the last few days had only gone into the website.
      I was still working on the Nav-bar and that took some time to make.</p>
    

    <div class="januar14">17.01.2020</div><p>Still working on the website and I'm close to finishing it.
    I probably would have used a template if I had known I was allowed to. Since I almost made it from scratch
    apart from the help I got from Youtube, it has taken a lot of time and is very time consuming.</p>
    

    <div class="januar14">19.01.2020</div><p>Still just working on the website, almost about to be finished.</p>
    

    <div class="januar14">21.01.2020</div><p>Today I finished the website. I'm very happy with the outcome and with what I learned from making it.
      I think the hardest part was making the Nav-bar and the front page in the "Home" area.

    <p1>Assignment 1, Documentation - Workload : 40 hours.</p1>
    
  <br>
  <br>

    <div class="januar14">05.02.2020</div><p>I went to FabLab to start assignment 2, 
    which was to make a pressfit construction kit. I decided to follow the video that Hafliði 
    had put on the classes website. I also decided to put a lid on the box. Full details of the 
    assignment can be seen in the assignment tab, and then into the computer-aided design and cutting tab.
    </p>

    <p1>Assignment 2, Computer-aided design and cutting - Workload : 5 hours.</p1>

    <br>
    <br>

    <div class="januar14">19.02.2020</div><p>I went to FabLab to start assignment 3, 
    Which was to make something that could not be cut out and 3D print it. I decided to make 
    a dog bowl since i own a dog. I realized that if I were to 3D print a full sized dog bowl 
    it would take me 28 hours to 3D print the bowl. I then decided to make the bowl a lot smaller. 
    Instead of taking 28 hours I made it smaller so it would only take 2 hours. </p>
    
    <div class="januar14">26.02.2020</div><p>I started 3D scanning and it took more time than I anticipated.
    I used Regard3D to 3d scan. I 3D scanned my car, it was a lot off trouble for me and took quite a long time 
    since the outcome was never clear enough and I had to start again. I did the simulation around 5 time and never got a 
    clear outcome. In the end I managed to get the it but it took a lot of time.
    </p>
    

    <p1>Assignment 3, 3D scannning and printing - Workload : 20 hours.</p1>

    <div class="januar14">02.03.2020</div><p>My group started planning the final project, we started drawing what we wanted to do.
      We didn't do much but now we have some idea of what we want to do for the final project. 
    </p>
    <div class="januar14">05.03.2020</div><p>The group discussed today how we were going to split up the project.
      We made some progress but still a long way to go.
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="januar14">22.03.2020</div><p>I realized I hadn't been updating the site frequently so I decided to take the whole day
      and just work on the site. I uploaded assignment 2 and 3 on to the site, it took a lot of time as i wanted to do it well.
      I also wanted to make some improvements on the site and did that. I also updated my diary as it was outdated.
    </p>
    <div class="januar14">23.03.2020</div><p>I continued to work on the site, today I updated assignment 1 and documented that.
      I put on the website how I made the website. 
    </p>

    <p1>Updating the website and catching up - Workload : 16 hours.</p1>
  
    <br>
    <br>
  
    <div class="januar14">29.03.2020</div><p>
    The group started work on the final project we decided to make a cutting board for the kitchen with resin inside.
    We used Inventor to draw it up. We decided to make the board rectangular and with a handle on the end off the cutting board.
    We made a hole on the handle so that we could hang it up on something like a hook. In the beginning we made the cutting board
    have a bottom part but in the end we decided to have it epoxy all the way through as shown in the description of the project. 
    As we could not execute the project we would have chosen something like oak.
    </p>
    
    <br>
    <br>
  
    <div class="januar14">30.03.2020</div><p>
    Today we made the MIT license for our project and we also made the bill of materials which did not take that much time. 
    </p>
  
    <br>
    <br>
  
    <div class="januar14">02.04.2020</div><p>
    Today we just made some changes to the cutting board and just made it look nicer.
    </p>
  
     <p1>Final project without execution - Workload : 8 hours.</p1>
