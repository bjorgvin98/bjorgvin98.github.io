    <div class="januar12">12.01.2020</div><p>I started working on my website it didn't go so well, I found a video that I was going to use but in the end I ended up not using it as I didn't like it so much.</p>
    <p></p>
    <div class="januar14">14.01.2020</div><p>I continued working on my website, I found a video that I liked. I clicked the video and started watching it. I copied the video and started making some real progress in making my site. </p>
    <p></p>
    <div class="januar15">15.janúar</div><p>I sat down and started working on my site. 
    I had watched the video and was getting somewhere but I still didn't like what I had. 
    I started to watch other videos and implement them into my website, 
    I also went on to stackoverflow to get help with the CSS to make the site look better. 
    I worked for a quite long time as i got really deep into it and was enjoying it.
    This was the first time I started to get somewhere and I liked what I saw.</p>
